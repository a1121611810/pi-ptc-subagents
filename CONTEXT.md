# Glossary — pi-ptc-subagents

Terms captured during wayfinder chart session on 2026-09-21. This is glossary
only — no implementation lives here. Source of truth for decision-records is
the wayfinder map issue (`wayfinder:map` label).

## Project terms

**pi-ptc-subagents** — this npm package. Hosts a pi extension that implements
DSH PTC mode. The repo name carries `-subagents` for historical reasons (a
previous `pi-subagents` peer existed); **subagents are explicitly not in scope
for the current effort** (see wayfinder map, 2026-09-21 grill round 3).

**PTC mode** = **P**rogrammable **T**ool **C**alling, also known as
DSH "Code Mode" before the August-2026 rename. The model submits a program
(JS / TS) that composes multiple tools in one shot, and only the program's
return value plus collected logs flow back into the model's context.

**dsh** = DeepSeek Harness, `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` on GitHub. Source
of truth for what PTC mode "means" behaviour-wise; pi-ptc must be re-aligned
to dsh's current behaviour (not the old pi-ptc SPEC's frozen decisions — see
map decisions).

## pi-side terms

**default-on / 默认开启** — for this package, "default-enabled" means: a user
who runs `pi install npm:pi-ptc-subagents` immediately gets the PTC tools
(`ptc_run_code`, `ptc_workflow`) on next pi startup, with **no** extra setup.
Mechanism: pi reads the npm package's `package.json` `pi.extensions` field
and registers the extension in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` automatically.
**Not** a postinstall hook. **Not** a manual `pi-ptc install` CLI command.

**binding** — a pi tool whose `execute` is callable from within a PTC
program as `tools.<name>(args)`. DSH uses a generated TS SDK with one
typed function per tool. The pi version is data-driven via the
`BINDING_NAMES` whitelist (not yet built for this effort; pin during G1 /
G2 decision).

**helper** — a global function injected into the PTC worker's runtime.
DSH's helpers are: `log`, `phase`, `result`, `parallel`, `pipeline`,
`agent`. The `agent()` helper is a stub in this effort (its seam shape is
decided in the G1 grilling ticket; full implementation is a future map).

**run_code** — the model-facing tool name DSH exposes in PTC mode. The pi
version exposes `ptc_run_code` to avoid collision with pi's hypothetical
future native `run_code`, plus a sidekick `ptc_workflow` for structured
(with `meta` + `args`) runs.

## Out-of-glossary (do not confuse)

- **DSH `subagent`** (a separate dsh concept: continuable sub-agent with
  capability flags) is NOT the same as the historical `pi-subagents` npm
  package. Neither is in scope here; both surface only via the `agent()`
  helper stub.

- **DSH preset / agent-preset** (Standard / PTC / Minimal / Creative) is a
  dsh-side concept. pi has no equivalent preset system today; this package
  is *only* the PTC mode implementation, not a preset framework.
